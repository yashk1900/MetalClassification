### Metal Surface Classification and Analysis using CNN ###

1. Fractographic classification is generally performed manually by analyzing the SEM images of fracture surfaces. 
2. This work aims to assist humans in this area, making the process less time-consuming and maintaining result consistency by using the capability of computer vision.
3. Various deep learning-based models, specifically CNNs, were used to classify the SEM images of fracture surfaces. 
4. The low amount and type of data provided challenges to the classification task. 
5. Results of several of these models were analyzed and compared, with each result giving us a probability of a particular class of fracture based on the image fed to the model. 
6. Heat Maps proved to be very useful in analysis, as they highlighted areas of the image the model had considered to give a specific outcome.
7. Modified VGG16 and ResNet50 proved to be best suited for the dataset provided.
